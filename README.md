# SeptemBIT 2021: Auto layout tool

This is a small tool to let you display mutli lenght animations on the SeptemBIT2021 Layout!  
Just create the folders correctly numbered (01-30) and drop your aseprite file in them! It should be able to export it as GIF automatically.

![layout](https://github.com/Daxidz/septembit-layout/blob/master/img/layout.png)

It uses both [Aseprite Wizard](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/713) and [godot-gdgifexporter](https://github.com/jegor377/godot-gdgifexporter) addons.



## TO DO
- Improve the gif export, which is quite long for now  
- Let it be used as a standalone app and not a Godot project
